OPERATORS

In R, there are four main types of operators:
Arithmetic
Relational 
Logical
Assignment 

## Arithmetic operators
Arithmetic operators let you perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

The table below summarizes the different arithmetic operators in R. The examples used in the table are based on the creation of two variables: : x equals 2 and y equals 5. 
Note that you use the assignment operator to store these values: 
x <- 2
y <- 5

+                                                    Addition                                      x + y                                    [1] 7

-                                                   Subtraction                                    x - y                                    [1] -3

*                                                  Multiplication                                  x * y                                    [1] 10

/                                                    Division                                      x / y                                    [1] 0.4

%%                                Modulus (returns the remainder after division)                   y %% x                                   [1] 1

%/%                          Integer division (returns an integer value after division)            y%/% x                                    [1] 2

^                                                    Exponent                                      y ^ x                                     [1]25


## Relational operators
Relational operators, also known as comparators, allow you to compare values. 
Relational operators identify how one R object relates to anotherâ€”like whether an object is less than, equal to, or greater than another object. 
The output for relational operators is either TRUE or FALSE (which is a logical data type, or boolean).

The table below summarizes the six relational operators in R. The examples used in the table are based on the creation of two variables: x equals 2 and y equals 5. 
Note that you use the assignment operator to store these values.
x <- 2
y <- 5

If you perform calculations with each operator, you get the following results. In this case, the output is boolean: TRUE or FALSE. 
Note that the [1] that appears before each output is used to represent how output is displayed in RStudio.

Operator                                               Description                                   Example Code                          Result/Output

<                                                       Less than                                      x < y                                [1] TRUE

>                                                      Greater than                                    x > y                                [1] FALSE

<=                                                Less than or equal to                               x < = 2                               [1] TRUE

>=                                               Greater than or equal to                             y >= 10                               [1] FALSE

==                                                       Equal to                                     y == 5                                [1] TRUE

!=                                                      Not equal to                                  x != 2                                [1] FALSE


## Logical operators
Logical operators allow you to combine logical values. Logical operators return a logical data type or boolean (TRUE or FALSE).

The table below summarizes the logical operators in R.

Operator                                                             Description

&                                                              Element-wise logical AND

&&                                                                    Logical AND

|                                                              Element-wise logical OR

||                                                                    Logical OR 

!                                                                     Logical NOT


Next, check out some examples of how logical operators work in R code. 

Element-wise logical AND (&) and OR (|)
You can illustrate logical AND (&) and OR (|) by comparing numerical values. Create a variable x that is equal to 10. 

x <- 10

The AND operator returns TRUE only if both individual values are TRUE. 
x > 2 & x < 12
[1] TRUE
10 is greater than 2 and 10 is less than 12. So, the operation evaluates to TRUE. 

The OR operator (|) works in a similar way to the AND operator (&). The main difference is that just one of the values of the OR operation needs to be TRUE for the entire OR operation to evaluate to TRUE. 
Only if both values are FALSE will the entire OR operation evaluate to FALSE.

Now try an example with the same variable (x <- 10): 
x > 2 | x < 8
[1] TRUE
10 is greater than 2, but 10 is not less than 8. But since at least one of the values (10>2) is TRUE, the OR operation evaluates to TRUE. 

Logical NOT (!)
The NOT operator simply negates the logical value, and evaluates to its opposite. In R, zero is considered FALSE and all non-zero numbers are considered TRUE. 

For example, apply the NOT operator to your variable (x <- 10):  
!(x < 15)
[1] FALSE
The NOT operation evaluates to FALSE because it takes the opposite logical value of the statement x < 15, which is TRUE (10 is less than 15).

## Assignment operators
Assignment operators let you assign values to variables. 
In many scripting programming languages you can just use the equal sign (=) to assign a variable. For R, the best practice is to use the arrow assignment (<-). 
Technically, the single arrow assignment can be used in the left or right direction. But the rightward assignment is not generally used in R code. 
You can also use the double arrow assignment, known as a scoping assignment. But the scoping assignment is for advanced R users. 

The table below summarizes the assignment operators and example code in R. Notice that the output for each variable is its assigned value.
