## Anscombe's quartet

Anscombe's quartet has four datasets that have nearly identical summary statistics. But those summary statistics might be misleading. 
Data visualizations, especially for datasets like these, are so important. They help us discover things in our data that would otherwise remain hidden. 
Plus, you'll discover some of the ways R can create awesome visualizations. Let's install the packages.
install.packages('Tmisc')
library(Tmisc)

Let's load the Anscombe's quartet data now.
data(quartet)
View(quartet)

When we view this data, we notice that there's four sets of x and y axis in the data frame. That's the quartet. 
Data can be summarized by different statistical measures. We'll get a summary of each set with the mean, standard deviation, and correlation for each of these datasets. 
We'll start by indicating that we want to group our data by set. Then we'll input our summarize function.
> quartet%>%
+   group_by(set) %>%
+   summarize(mean(x),sd(x),mean(y),sd(y),cor(x,y))
# A tibble: 4 Ã— 6
  set   `mean(x)` `sd(x)` `mean(y)` `sd(y)` `cor(x, y)`
  <fct>     <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>       <dbl>
1 I             9    3.32      7.50    2.03       0.816
2 II            9    3.32      7.50    2.03       0.816
3 III           9    3.32      7.5     2.03       0.816
4 IV            9    3.32      7.50    2.03       0.817

After we run this, we'll get a summary of these statistical measures. In our summary table, we can check the mean. The mean for x in each dataset is 9, and the mean for y is 7.5. 
The standard deviation can help us understand the spread of values in a dataset and show us how far each value is from the mean. 
The standard deviation for x and y in every set in the quartet is the same, 3.32 and 2.03. 
Finally, we've got our correlation, which shows us how strong the relationship between two variables is. Here, it looks like the correlation between x and y in all four sets is around 0.816. 
Based on the summaries we created with our statistical measures, these datasets are identical, but sometimes just looking at the summarized data can be misleading. 

Let's put together some simple graphs to help us visualize this data and check if the datasets are actually identical. 
ggplot(quartet, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~set)

NOTE: method="lm" is used to specify linear regression, and facet_wrap(~set), the tilde ~ is required to indicate the variable for faceting.
This will display each subset of Anscombe's quartet with points and a linear regression line.
These four datasets appear quite different when we visualize them. If we just gone with a statistical summaries, we never would have known that this data is actually really different. 

## The datasauRus package. 

The datasauRus creates plots with the Anscombe data in different shapes. First, you'll start off with installing and loading the package. Then we'll create a chart.
install.packages('datasauRus')
library(datasauRus)
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen,aes(x=x,y=y,colour=dataset))+geom_point()+theme_void()+theme(legend.position = "none")+facet_wrap(~dataset,ncol=3)

When we run this, it shows us several different plots. There's the famous dinosaur, a bull's eye, a star, R is a pretty powerful visualization tool. 
You could use the relationships between data points to create many other shapes.
