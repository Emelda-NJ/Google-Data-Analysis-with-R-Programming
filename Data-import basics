## The data() function 
The default installation of R comes with a number of preloaded datasets. 
You can use the data() function to load these datasets in R. If you run the data function without an argument, R will display a list of the available datasets.

This includes the list of preloaded datasets from the datasets package.

Use ‘data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))’
to list the data sets in all *available* packages.

If you want to load a specific dataset, just enter its name in the parentheses of the data() function. 
For example, let’s load the mtcars dataset, which has information about cars that have been featured in past issues of Motor Trend magazine. 

data(mtcars)

R tells us that it contains 32 observations and 11 variables. 
Now that the dataset is loaded, you can get a preview of it in the R console pane. Just type its name...and then press ctrl (or cmnd) and enter.

mtcars

You can also display the dataset by clicking directly on the name of the dataset in the Environment pane; R automatically runs the View() function and displays the dataset in the RStudio data viewer. 

## The readr package
The readr package in R is a great tool for reading rectangular data. 
Rectangular data is data that fits nicely inside a rectangle of rows and columns, with each column referring to a single variable and each row referring to a single observation. 

# Here are some examples of file types that store rectangular data:
.csv (comma separated values): a .csv file is a plain text file that contains a list of data. They mostly use commas to separate (or delimit) data, but sometimes they use other characters, like semicolons. 
.tsv (tab separated values): a .tsv file stores a data table in which the columns of data are separated by tabs. For example, a database table or spreadsheet data. 
.fwf (fixed width files): a .fwf file has a specific format that allows for the saving of textual data in an organized fashion. 
.log: a .log file is a computer-generated file that records events from operating systems and other software programs.

The readr package is part of the core tidyverse. So, if you’ve already installed the tidyverse, you have what you need to start working with readr.

# readr functions
The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data. readr supports several read_ functions. Each function refers to a specific file format.
read_csv(): comma-separated values (.csv) files
read_tsv(): tab-separated values files
read_delim(): general delimited files
read_fwf(): fixed-width files
read_table(): tabular files where columns are separated by white-space
read_log(): web log files

These functions all have similar syntax, so once you learn how to use one of them, you can apply your knowledge to the others.

# Reading a .csv file with readr 
Let’s use the read_csv() function to read the “mtcars.csv” file, as an example. In the parentheses, you need to supply the path to the file. In this case, it’s “readr_example(“mtcars.csv”). 

read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))

When you run the function, R prints out a column specification that gives the name and type of each column. 
Rows: 32 Columns: 11                                                                           
── Column specification ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delimiter: ","
dbl (11): mpg, cyl, disp, hp, drat, wt, qsec, vs, am, gear, carb

ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

R also prints a tibble. 
# A tibble: 32 × 11

## The readxl package
To import spreadsheet data into R, you can use the readxl package. The readxl package makes it easy to transfer data from Excel into R. 
Readxl supports both the legacy .xls file format and the modern xml-based .xlsx file format. 
The readxl package is part of the tidyverse but is not a core tidyverse package, so you need to load readxl in R by using the library() function.  

library(readxl)

# Reading an .xlsx file with readxl
You can use the read_excel() function to read a spreadsheet file just like you used read_csv() function to read a  .csv file. The code for reading the example file “type-me.xlsx” includes the path to the file in the parentheses of the function.  

read_excel(readxl_example("type-me.xlsx"))
# A tibble: 10 × 2

 2 0                "0 (numeric)"                       
 3 1                "1 (numeric)"                       
 4 40908            "datetime"                          
 5 TRUE             "boolean true"                      
 6 FALSE            "boolean false"                     
 7 cabbage          "\"cabbage\""                       
 8 true             "the string \"true\""               
 9 F                "the letter \"F\""                  
10 False            "\"False\" preceded by single quote"

You can use the excel_sheets() function to list the names of the individual sheets. 

excel_sheets(readxl_example("type-me.xlsx"))
[1] "logical_coercion" "numeric_coercion" "date_coercion" "text_coercion"

You can also specify a sheet by name or number.  Just type “sheet =” followed by the name or number of the sheet. For example, you can use the sheet named “numeric_coercion” from the list above. 
When you run the function, R returns a tibble of the sheet.

read_excel(readxl_example("type-me.xlsx"), sheet = "numeric_coercion")
# A tibble: 7 × 2

2 TRUE             "boolean true"         
3 FALSE            "boolean false"
